# Ultrasound Image Segmentation

Full details of the project can be found on my blog here: http://www.kevinkeller.me/?project=image-segmentation

To run the scripts simply call "python bicep_script.py" and then enter the path to the image folder.

To run the notebooks run "jupyter notebook" from the folder. It will open the browser so you can play with the code.
